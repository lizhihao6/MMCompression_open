## Introduction

MMSegmentation is an open source semantic segmentation toolbox based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

<details open>
<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Unified Benchmark**

  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various semantic compression methods.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the learning based compression framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized AI compression framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple methods out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary AI compression frameworks, *e.g.* NLAIC, TinyLIC, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases.
